# Nomonia
An Android app that tells if someone has bacterial Pneumonia based on their Chest x-ray. 

## How was this build
* The model was built from scratch using Tensorflow using a custom CNN which was later converted into a lighter version 
which can be used for inference on mobile devices. 
* The android application was made on a native environment using Android Studio.
* `model.tflite` contains the lite model that can be used by the user to do inference on their own devices.
* I've also added few images that one can use to see the working of the app.
